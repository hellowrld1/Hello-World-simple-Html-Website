# Hello-World-simple-Html-Website
Just a simple website that says hello world
just take the code and do whatever you want with it add to it or keep it the same I dont really care what you do with it
the part of the code that has h1 is the header
the part with the p is the text/paragraph you want there
if you want more paragraphs just add more
